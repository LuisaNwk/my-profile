        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>I am currently a M1 student in the Master in Mangement program of HEC Paris, from which I will graduate in 2022. I have previously finished my Bachelor of International Business Administration at WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management in 2019. During my bachelor studies, I have attended a semester abroad at MUN - Memorial University of Newfoundlad in Canada. In 2015, I finished the German school system with my Abitur and decided to take a gap-year at St. Clare's Oxford.</p>

        <h3> Get to know me</h3>
        <h4 class="h4-blue"> Adventure - Food - Climbing </h4>
        <p>
          I love going on adventures. This could be hicking up 3.000 meters to the top of a mountain, going sailing in the Mediterranean Sea, or going on late night McDonald's runs. I especially love all adventures that involve making our own fire and even cooking over it. I love making and especially eating all kinds of food. I have a strong passion for baking and love try new meals. Lastly, this year I have started to go climbing and fell in love with it. It gives me the great opportunity to conquer my fear of heights and brings me together with new people.
